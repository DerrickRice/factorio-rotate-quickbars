# Rotate Quickbars

A factorio (>=0.17) mod.

![Thumbnail](thumbnail.png)

Adds the ability to rotate all visible quickbars up or down, as well as to increment or decrement all visible quickbars.

By default, Factorio only provides the option to rotate the quickbars in a single direction (defaults to 'x' on most keyboard layouts).

**WARNING:** Currently inoperable due to a suspected bug in Factorio. Work in progress!

## Examples
